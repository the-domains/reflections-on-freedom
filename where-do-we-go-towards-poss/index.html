Revised and re-published here January 4th 2016]</i></p><p>In 2012, James Governor coined the term POSS — Post Open Source Software — as a way to capture the feeling of a perceived young group of new developers feeling that we should all just “fuck the license and governance, [and] commit to github.” In our fast paced development environment, we’ve established free and open source software as the norm for development. We’ve developed the legal tools that go with it in order to make it work under current legislation. The Free Software Foundation and others have developed licenses for software that can be easily applied when distributing it; Creative Commons have developed the licenses that are needed to distribute free culture. It’s a shame that we have not spent more time on simplifying licensing.</p><p>For a very long time, there’s been a miss match between current laws and technology. It’s clear that copyright haven’t kept up with the pace of developments, and bills to amend copyright law have focused more on entrenching existing rights rather than relaxing them. It’s fortunate that we live in a time when awareness of this miss match is building, and where real changes to copyright is within reach. We live in a time where, within five to ten years, we will see increased exceptions in copyright for private and non-profit use. But those exceptions have already been factored in by the industry benefiting from the current legislation. And it doesn't mean that copyright for software will magically go away, or that we want it to magically go away.</p><p>If we accept the principles of POSS development — a tempting alternative if we feel that the current system is miss matched to reality — we fuck copyright and put our shit on Github, the future looks relatively certain: it’ll be filled with uncertainty. Without a license on the code that’s put on Github, it’ll be technically illegal for anyone to copy it and re-use it in their own context. As long as everyone plays nice and follow the POSS principles, it’ll all be fine, but the risk will never quite go away. At any one point the author of the code you used could for whatever reason choose to claim copyright infringement, and the courts would rule in their favor. This is particularly damning for business adoption of Free Software.</p><p>We can try to factor in that risk when developing, trying to isolate pieces that we’re uncertain about to make them easy to replace, stop sharing source code and hope that no one notices, or just hide it away in our code and put our own copyright notice on it, again hoping that no one notices. It doesn’t feel too tempting. But the answer is not as easy as simply saying that people should pay more attention to copyright. We can’t spend all our resources educating in a system that is miss matched to society.</p><p>The onerous to figure things out is on those of us who feel that copyright is still important to pay attention to and that the alternative —not caring about copyright, is much worse. Let us all agree that copyright and licenses are difficult to understand, that not everyone wants or can understand them, and find solutions that make it possible to develop and enjoy software without understanding copyright. We have years of experience with abstracting technology, let us adopt the same principles of abstraction to law.
